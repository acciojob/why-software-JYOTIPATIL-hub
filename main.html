	  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>I want to become a developer because I love solving problems and creating things. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world challenges. I find it rewarding to see my code come to life and make a positive impact on people's lives. I also like the flexibility and creativity that software development offers. I can work on projects that I am passionate about and express myself through code.</p>
